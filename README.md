# Need to know
- This project has been created with [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Tests with [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- Used [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) for managing the libraries and the account state.

_I researched a little bit and found that is a bit tricky to check the state of the account because we have the ask for it constantly_
